# multitagplayer

Multitag player is a music player created to better use of tabletop RPG soundtracks. During a session, the DM (Dungeon Master - the person who manages the game experience) often uses music to set the story's mood, but sometimes this requires an increased amount of time due to the fact that a battle, for example, may require a large number of songs.

Multitag allows you to create tags for music helping you condense them on thematic distinct playlists.

This music player was made in 2014. It uses Google API to load songs from the user's Google Drive folder.
